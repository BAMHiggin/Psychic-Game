# Psychic-Game
A word guessing game built using Javascript.


The purpose of this game is to have the user guess the random A-Z letter that the computer generates

The user will have 7 guesses to find the letter

The computer will keep track of games won and games lost without refreshing

The computer will collect user input of guessed letters and display on street throughout game



Guessing - user will input a letter


If wrong:
		letter will appear in Guesses So Far on screen for remainder of round
		-1 to Guesses Left

If all 7 guesses are exhausted to 0
		+1 added to Losses
		Guesses left will reset to 7
		letters on screen will be cleared (without refresh)
		
		
If correct:
		+1 will be added to wins
		Guesses left will reset to 7
		letters on screen will be cleared (without refresh)
